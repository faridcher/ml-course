plotData <- function (x, y) {
  #PLOTDATA Plots the data points x and y into a new figure
  #   PLOTDATA(x,y) plots the data points and gives the figure axes labels of
  #   population and profit.
  
  # ---------------------- YOUR CODE HERE ----------------------
  # Instructions: Plot the training data into a figure using the
  #               "plot" command. Set the axes labels using
  #               the "xlab" and "ylab" parameters of plot function. 
  #               Assume the population and revenue data have been passed in
  #               as the x and y arguments of this function.
  #
  # Hint: You can use the pch=4 and col="red" options with plot to have the markers
  #       appear as red crosses. Furthermore, you can make the
  #       markers larger by using plot(..., cex=1.1). cex stands for character expansion
